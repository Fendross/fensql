# Overview

A simple sqlite clone written in C, with the final goal of deeply understanding database systems.
Here's the simplified system architecture of sqlite:

## How does it work

The input to the **frontend** is basically a query written in SQL. We can imagine the frontend as being composed of the following parts:

- tokenizer
- parser
- code generator

The output is **sqlite virtual machine bytecode**, a compiled program that can operate on the database itself.
The **backend** consists of:

- _**virtual machine**_: takes the bytecode generated by the FE as instructions
- _**B-tree**_: the chosen data structure for tables and indexes. It consists of many nodes, and each of them is one page in length
- _**pager**_: receives commands to read or write pages of data directly from or to the database file
- _**OS interface**_: layer that differs depending on the OS
